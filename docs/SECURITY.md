# Security Policy - Educational Project

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This is an **internship learning project**, NOT production software. This security policy is included for educational purposes to demonstrate understanding of security practices, but this code should NEVER be deployed in real environments.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (Educational Context)

### Overview

This policy demonstrates security vulnerability disclosure practices as learned during my internship. Since this is educational code, actual vulnerabilities should be reported with the understanding this is a learning project.

**Note**: For vulnerabilities in the upstream MITRE Caldera framework, please report to the official Caldera project.

This policy describes:
- What systems are covered (educational code only)
- How to submit vulnerability reports (for learning purposes)
- Expected timeline (no SLA - this is not production software)

### Scope

This policy applies to this educational internship project:
- Custom plugin implementations (educational code by intern)
- Development environment configurations
- Documentation and examples

**Out of Scope**:
- Production deployments (this project should never be deployed in production)
- Official Triskele Labs systems (this is NOT official TL software)
- Third-party dependencies (report to upstream maintainers)
- Commercial operations (prohibited use)

### What to Include in Your Report

To help me learn from security feedback, please include:

- Operating system and Python version used
- Description of the vulnerability location and potential impact in this educational code
- Detailed reproduction steps (proof-of-concept scripts or screenshots are helpful)
- Suggested remediation if available

### Where to Report

**For this educational project**:
- Email: tonyto02@proton.me
- Subject: "Security Issue - Internship Project Code"

**For actual MITRE Caldera issues**:
- Report to the official MITRE Caldera project (this is not affiliated)

### Response (Educational Project)

As this is an educational/portfolio project by an intern:

- I will acknowledge receipt within 5-10 business days
- This is a learning exercise - no SLA or guaranteed response time
- Issues will be addressed as time permits (educational purposes only)
- This is NOT production s (Learning Exercise)

**⚠️ Reminder**: This code is for learning purposes and should NEVER be deployed in production.

These practices demonstrate security knowledge learned during the internship:

When setting up the *HTTPS connections (learning exercise)
- Restrict network access to required ports only
- Regularly update dependencies and apply security patches
- Use API key authentication for automated integrations
- Implement role-based access control
- Enable audit logging for all operations
- Regularly backup configuration and data
- Review and rotate API keys periodically

**Note**: These are security practices learned during the internship, demonstrated in educational code.
