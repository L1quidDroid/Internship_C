Here's a structured GitHub Copilot prompt using best practices for documentation generation:

## GitHub Copilot Prompt

```markdown
# Task: Restructure and Consolidate Caldera Repository Documentation

## Context
This is a Caldera adversary emulation platform repository with extensive but scattered documentation. The goal is to create a well-organized, user-friendly documentation structure that serves both end users and developers.

## Current State
The repository contains:
- Multiple deployment guides (DEPLOYMENT-README.md, DEPLOYMENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md, DEPLOYMENT-ERROR-ANALYSIS.md)
- Phase-specific implementation docs (PHASE-4-*.md files)
- Existing core docs (README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Development artifacts (SESSION-SUMMARY-*.md, ERROR-SUMMARY.txt)
- Quick references (QUICK_REFERENCE.md, END_TO_END_USER_JOURNEY.md)

## Objectives
1. Create a comprehensive documentation structure in `/docs` directory
2. Consolidate redundant documentation files
3. Fill gaps in user guides, API references, and plugin development
4. Maintain clear navigation and discoverability
5. Archive development artifacts appropriately

```

## Specific Actions Required

### 1. Consolidation Tasks
- Merge DEPLOYMENT-README.md, DEPLOYMENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md, and DEPLOYMENT-ERROR-ANALYSIS.md into `/docs/deployment/`
- Extract troubleshooting content into dedicated troubleshooting guide
- Transform END_TO_END_USER_JOURNEY.md into structured user guide sections
- Archive PHASE-4-* files to `/archive/development-history/`

### 2. New Documentation to Create
- API Reference with REST endpoint specifications
- Plugin Development Guide with examples
- FAQ addressing common user questions
- Changelog for version tracking
- Migration guides for breaking changes

### 3. Enhancement Tasks
- Expand SECURITY.md with authentication/authorization details
- Add navigation links between related documents
- Create index pages for each docs subdirectory
- Add code examples and screenshots where relevant

## Requirements and Constraints

### Writing Style
- Clear, concise technical writing
- Active voice preferred
- Step-by-step instructions for procedures
- Code examples with syntax highlighting
- Consistent heading hierarchy

### Format Standards
- Markdown format for all documentation
- Use tables for configuration options
- Include prerequisite sections
- Add "Next Steps" navigation at document end
- Cross-reference related documentation

### Content Priorities
1. Installation and quick start (highest priority for new users)
2. User operations guide
3. Deployment options
4. API reference for integrations
5. Development and contribution guides

## Example Output Format

For each documentation file, include:

```markdown
# [Title]

## Overview
Brief description of what this document covers

## Prerequisites
- Required knowledge
- Required software/access
- Related documentation to read first

## [Main Content Sections]
...

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions

## Next Steps
- [Link to related documentation]
- [Link to advanced topics]

## See Also
- [Related references]
```

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] All existing content preserved or archived appropriately
- [ ] Clear navigation path from README to specialized docs
- [ ] No duplicate or contradictory information
- [ ] Complete user journey from installation to operation
- [ ] Developer documentation covers plugin creation and contribution
- [ ] All code examples tested and functional
- [ ] Links verified and working
- [ ] Consistent terminology throughout

## Notes
- Preserve all technical accuracy from existing documentation
- Maintain security warnings and best practices
- Keep troubleshooting insights from error analysis documents
- Reference MITRE ATT&CK framework where applicable
- Include Azure-specific deployment considerations
```

## Example Prompts for Specific Files

### Example 1: Creating API Reference

```markdown
Create a comprehensive API reference document for the Caldera REST API based on the codebase.

Requirements:
- Document all REST endpoints with HTTP methods
- Include authentication requirements
- Provide request/response examples in JSON
- Add error codes and descriptions
- Organize by functional area (Agents, Operations, Abilities, etc.)
- Include rate limiting information if applicable

Format as: /docs/technical/api-reference.md

Use this structure:
# API Reference
## Authentication
## Endpoints
### Agents
### Operations
### Abilities
...
## Error Codes
## Rate Limiting
```

### Example 2: Consolidating Deployment Docs

```markdown
Consolidate DEPLOYMENT-README.md, DEPLOYMENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md, and DEPLOYMENT-ERROR-ANALYSIS.md into organized deployment documentation.

Create three files:
1. /docs/deployment/azure-deployment.md - Azure-specific using Bicep templates
2. /docs/deployment/docker-deployment.md - Docker Compose configurations
3. /docs/deployment/troubleshooting.md - Common deployment issues and solutions

Requirements:
- Extract Azure Bicep deployment steps from existing docs
- Document all environment variables from .env.template
- Create troubleshooting decision tree from error analysis
- Include network configuration and firewall requirements
- Add verification steps after deployment
- Reference quick-start-b1s.sh script usage

Remove redundancy but preserve all unique technical details.
```

### Example 3: Plugin Development Guide

```markdown
Create a plugin development guide for extending Caldera functionality.

Use the orchestrator plugin as the primary example. Structure:

# Plugin Development Guide

## Overview
What plugins are and why create them

## Plugin Architecture
- Directory structure requirements
- Hook points and interfaces
- Configuration file format

## Step-by-Step Tutorial
Create a simple reporting plugin from scratch:
1. Directory setup
2. Configuration file
3. Python module structure
4. Registering hooks
5. Testing locally
6. Deployment

## Advanced Topics
- Custom UI components
- Database integration
- External API integration
- Performance considerations

## Examples
- Orchestrator plugin walkthrough
- Branding customization
- Custom planners

Include actual code snippets from plugins/ directory.
```

### Example 4: User Operations Guide

```markdown
Transform END_TO_END_USER_JOURNEY.md into a structured operations guide for the web interface.

Create /docs/user-guide/operations.md with:

## Sections Required:
1. Creating Adversary Profiles
2. Configuring Abilities and Techniques
3. Deploying and Managing Agents
4. Launching Operations
5. Monitoring Operation Progress
6. Analyzing Results
7. Generating Reports

For each section:
- Include screenshots of UI (note where screenshots should be added)
- Provide step-by-step procedures
- Explain decision points
- Add tips and best practices
- Link to relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques

Keep user journey flow but organize into logical reference sections.
```

### Example 5: Comprehensive FAQ

```markdown
Create a FAQ document based on common issues found in ERROR-SUMMARY.txt, troubleshooting documentation, and likely user questions.

Organize into categories:
- Installation and Setup
- Agent Deployment
- Operations and Campaigns
- Performance and Scaling
- Integration with Other Tools
- Security and Access Control
- Troubleshooting

For each question:
- Clear question in user's language
- Concise answer
- Link to detailed documentation
- Code examples where relevant

Include at least 20-25 questions covering beginner to advanced users.

Format as: /docs/reference/faq.md
```

## Best Practices Applied

**Specificity**: Each prompt includes exact file paths, structure requirements, and source materials.

**Context**: Provides background about the repository state and documentation goals.

**Constraints**: Defines format standards, writing style, and validation criteria.

**Examples**: Shows desired output structure with actual sections and formatting.

**Actionable**: Breaks down complex tasks into clear, executable steps with checkboxes.

**Iterative**: Each prompt focuses on one documentation area, allowing for review before proceeding.
