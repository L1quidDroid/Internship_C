# System Architecture - Learning Documentation

**Document Purpose**: This document explores the architectural patterns I 
learned while developing Caldera plugins during my Triskele Labs internship.

## Educational Context

This architecture demonstrates my understanding of:
- Plugin-based extensibility patterns
- Event-driven service communication
- Security automation workflows
- Integration with SIEM platforms (ELK Stack)

**Disclaimer**: This architecture was designed as a learning exercise. It has 
not been reviewed for production use, security-hardened for real environments, 
or tested at scale.

## Design Decisions (Learning Rationale)

I chose this architecture to learn:
- **Seven-plugin approach**: To understand modular design and separation of concerns
- **Event-driven patterns**: To practice asynchronous service communication
- **ELK integration**: To gain experience with security data correlation

[Rest of documentation with "I learned..." framing]

Subject: Internship Project Documentation - Review Request

Hi [Supervisor],

I've completed documentation for my internship project (Caldera plugin 
development) and would like your approval before sharing it in my portfolio 
or with potential employers.

I've ensured the documentation:
- Clearly labels this as an internship learning project
- Does NOT claim to be official Triskele Labs software
- Uses an educational license (not Apache-2.0)
- Contains disclaimers on every page
- Is set to PRIVATE on GitHub
- Contains no confidential Triskele Labs information

Key Questions for Your Review:
1. Is it clear this is an internship project, not official TL software?
2. Are the disclaimers sufficient to protect Triskele Labs from liability?
3. Is the license appropriate (Educational/Portfolio vs Apache-2.0)?
4. Are there any TL-specific details I should remove or generalize?
5. Do you approve sharing this with potential employers for job applications?

Please let me know if any changes are needed before I share this externally.

Thanks,

## Final Recommendations

### Make It Look Professional ✅

**DO**:
- Use clean documentation structure
- Include architecture diagrams
- Show comprehensive testing
- Demonstrate code quality
- Write clear installation guides
- Present well in demos

### But Keep It Educational ✅

**DO**:
- Add disclaimers on every page
- Frame as "learning exercise"
- Use "I learned" language
- Attribute as internship work
- Keep repository PRIVATE
- Use Educational license

### Legal Protection ✅

**DO**:
- Get supervisor approval
- Remove production/client language
- Add strong disclaimers
- Clarify NOT official TL software
- Keep confidential info out
- Use appropriate license

This approach lets you showcase professional-quality work while being legally clear it's an internship project, not production software.
